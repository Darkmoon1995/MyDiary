            <h3>Nothing Much</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Today was nice simple day, I went to school as always but it was boaring as always. After all no fun is allowed in schools huh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kinda in bad spot in terms of school beacuse i have to get back in my chemistry, and a lot more subjects.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Ideas</h3>
            <p>Today ideas are cool , i have this plan for custom lockscreen , but i have to do something about android studio beacuse it is not working.</p>
            <p>I also have youtube idea but i don't know if it's gonna work or not but i am going to try, the mission is simple.... a human wakes up at the age of 18 with all the data he wants but no items
                kinda like 'Dr.stone' but this guy isn't with someone and also it is no village ready for it so it's gonna be cool thing.
            </p>
            <p>I also am working on discord app but it's gonna take sometime to do. after all it's not that easy to run voice chat... with diffrent groups and sockets that easly, But i can try</p>
